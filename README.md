## Project Overview

**Survive-MVP** is a multiplayer game implemented as a Telegram MiniApp. Players join lobbies, participate in elimination-based rounds, and compete until one winner remains. The application supports two roles:

- **Player**: Joins lobbies, waits for the game to start, and participates in rounds.
- **Admin**: Manages lobbies, starts games manually or via schedules, and oversees game progress.

## Game Rules

The rules are super simple. Each round starts a countdown timer, and when it hits zero, half the players are randomly knocked outâ€”only the luckiest will survive to claim victory.

## Database Schema

The application uses **PostgreSQL** with three tables: `users`, `lobbies`, and `settings`. The schemas below are derived from the provided Sequelize models and technical requirements.

### `users` Table

Stores user information, including Telegram ID, username, role, and associated lobby.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | BIGINT | PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL | Unique Telegram user ID |
| username | VARCHAR | NOT NULL | User's Telegram username |
| role | VARCHAR | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'player' | Role: 'player' or 'admin' |
| lobby_id | INTEGER | NULL | ID of the associated lobby |

### `lobbies` Table

Stores lobby data, including status, players, and round information.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique lobby ID |
| status | VARCHAR(20) | DEFAULT 'waiting' | Status: 'waiting', 'active', 'finished' |
| players | JSONB |  | Array of `{id, username, status}` |
| round_number | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0 | Current round number |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Lobby creation time |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Last update time |

### `settings` Table

Stores global game settings, such as maximum players and round start delay.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique setting ID |
| max_players | INTEGER | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 100 | Maximum players per lobby |
| start_delay | INTEGER | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 60 | Round start delay (seconds) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Creation time |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Last update time |
